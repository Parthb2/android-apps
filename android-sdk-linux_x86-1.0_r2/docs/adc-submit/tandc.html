<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">7.  <b>FIRST ROUND</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">a.<b>  SUBMISSION OF
ENTRIES</b>:  To qualify for a Grant, an "Entry" to the
Challenge consists of an application that is written in the Java
programming language using the Android Software Development Kit
("SDK") (available at http://code.google.com/android). 
The SDK contains instructions, documentation, and all necessary tools
to enable a Participant to build an Android application. 
Individuals, teams, and Business Entities may submit an Entry by
visiting the Android Developer Challenge website and providing the
name, email address, mailing address, date of birth and phone number
of each Participant and uploading their Entry following the
directions found on the website any time before the end of the First
Round.  However, Google is not responsible for any claims or disputes
between one Participant and any other Participant regarding the
ownership of the Entry or the content within the Entry.  Google may
disqualify any individual Participant, Business Entity or Team,
without recourse and in its sole discretion, if any such claim or
dispute arises.  
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">b.  <b>LANGUAGE</b>:
 Entries must, at a minimum, support English language use but may
also support other languages at the discretion of the Participant.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">c.  <b>JUDGING</b>:
 After the submission period for the First Round of the Challenge
ends, all Entries will be judged by a panel of experts in the fields
of mobile devices, cellular telecommunications, software development,
and/or technology innovation ("Judges").  Google will
select the Judges from the member organizations of the Open Handset
Alliance, Google and/or mobile experts.  Decisions of the Judges are final and
binding.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">d.  <b>QUALIFICATION</b>:
 For the First Round of the Challenge, the Judges will consider each
Entry under the following equally-weighted judging criteria:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(1) Originality of
Concept - Does the application introduce a great new idea; for
example, a new angle on social applications?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(2) Effective Use of
the Android Platform - Does the application take advantage of
Android's unique and compelling features, such as built-in
location-based services, accelerometer, and always-on networking?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(3) Polish and Appeal -
Is the application easy to use and aesthetically appealing?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(4) Indispensability -
Is the application compelling and essential, such as a game the user
just can't put down or a utility she can't live without?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">Using these
criteria, the Judges will evaluate each Entry and give it a score. 
The fifty (50) Entries with the highest scores will be determined to
be "Qualifying Entries" and will receive the Qualifying
Grant described below. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">e.  <b>QUALIFYING
GRANT</b>.  Each Participant that submitted a Qualifying Entry will
receive a grant of $25,000 USD (twenty-five thousand dollars)
("Qualifying Grant") so long as the Participant complies
with these Terms.  If a Participant submits more than one Qualifying
Entry, that Participant will receive multiple Qualifying Grants
appropriate to the number of Qualifying Entries submitted.  In the
event of a tie, judges will select the Participant who scored the
highest in "Effective Use of the Android Platform."

Business Entity.  Google will award the Qualifying Grant to the one
(1) member of the team or Business Entity, who is identified by each
member of the team or Business Entity to receive the Qualifying Grant
as part of the Registration process.  That person is then responsible
for dividing and distributing the Qualifying Grant to all members of
the team or Business Entity.  In addition, in the event the

person entitled to bind the Business Entity must also approve the
distribution of the grant.</p>

Business Entity, must agree to the terms of these agreements and must

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">8.<b>  SECOND ROUND</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">a.  <b>RESUBMISSION

the Participant complies with these Terms.  
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.17in;">e.  <b>DISTRIBUTION

Business Entity is selected to potentially receive a First or Second
Place Grant, all members of the team or a person with the authority

receive the grants described in this Section.  Failure to comply with
this requirement will mean that Participant has forfeited the
applicable grant and Google may, in its sole discretion, select an
alternative Participant to receive the First or Second Place Grant.</p>
