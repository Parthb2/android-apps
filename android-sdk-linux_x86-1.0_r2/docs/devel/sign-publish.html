<h1>Signing and Publishing Your Applications</h1>

<h2 id="versioning">Versioning Your Applications</h2>

<p>Versioning is a critical component of your application upgrade/maintenance
strategy.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Users need to have specific information about the application version that
is installed on their devices and the upgrade versions available for
installation. </li>
<li>Other applications &mdash; including other applications that you publish as
a suite &mdash; need to query the system for your application's version, to
determine compatibility and identify dependencies.</li>
<li>Services through which you will publish your application(s) may also need to
query your application for its version, so that they can display the version to
users. A publishing service may also need to check the application version to
determine compatibility and establish upgrade/downgrade relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Android system itself <em>does not ever</em> check the version
information for an application, such as to enforce restrictions on upgrades,
compatibility, and so on. Instead, only users or applications themselves are
responsible for enforcing any version restrictions. </p>

<p>To define the version information for your application, you set attributes in
the application's manifest file. Two attributes are available, and you should
always define values for both of them: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>android:versionCode</code> &mdash; An integer value that represents
the version of the application code, relative to other versions. 

<p>The value is an integer so that other applications can programatically
evaluate it, for example to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship. You can
set the value to any integer you want, however you should make sure that each
successive release of your application uses a greater value. The system does not
enforce this behavior, but increasing the value with successive releases is
normative. </p>

<p>Typically, you would release the first version of your application with
versionCode set to 1, then monotonically increase the value with each release,
regardless whether the release constitutes a major or minor release. This means
that the <code>android:versionCode</code> value does not necessarily have a
strong resemblence to the application release version that is visible to the
user (see <code>android:versionName</code>, below). Applications and publishing
services should not display this version value to users.</p>
</li>
<li><code>android:versionName</code> &mdash; A string value that represents the
release version of the application code, as it should be shown to users. 
<p>The value is a string so that you can describe the application version as a
&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;point&gt; string, or as any other type of
absolute or relative version identifier. </p>

<p>As with <code>android:versionCode</code>, the system does not use this value
for any internal purpose, other than to enable applications to display it to
users. Publishing services may also extract the <code>android:versionName</code>
value for display to users.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You define both of these version attributes in the
<code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element of the manifest file. </p>

<p>Here's an example manifest that shows the <code>android:versionCode</code>
and <code>android:versionName</code> attributes in the
<code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element. </p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      package="com.example.package.name"
      android:versionCode="2"
      android:versionName="1.1"&gt;
    &lt;application android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="@string/app_name"&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, note that <code>android:versionCode</code> value indicates
that the current .apk contains the second release of the application code, which
corresponds to a minor follow-on release, as shown by the
<code>android:codeName</code> string. </p>

<p>The Android framework provides an API to let applications query the system
for version information about your application. To obtain version information,
applications use the 
<a href="../reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#getPackageInfo(java.lang.String, int)">getPackageInfo(java.lang.String, int)</a> 
method of <a href="../reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">PackageManager</a>. </p>

<p>If your application requires a specific minimum version of the Android
platform, you can also specify that in the manifest file: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>android:minSdkVersion</code> &mdash; An integer value corresponding to
the code version of the Android platform. 
<p>When preparing to install an application, the system checks the value of this
attribute and compares it to the system version. If the
<code>android:minSdkVersion</code> value is greater than the system version, the
system aborts the installation of the application. </p>

<p>If you do not specify this attribute in your manifest, the system assumes
that your application is compatible with all platform versions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To specify a minimum platform version for your application, add a
<code>&lt;uses-sdk&gt;</code> element as a child of
<code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code>, then define the
<code>android:minSdkVersion</code> as an attribute. Currently, only one platform
version has been released for mobile devices &mdash; that version is "1". For
this reason, you do not need to define this attribute in your application and,
at this point, defining it is <em>not recommended</em>.</p>

<a name="signing" id="signing"></a>

<h2>Signing Your Applications</h2>

<p>The Android system requires that all installed applications be digitally
signed with a certificate whose private key is held by the application's
developer. The system uses the certificate as a means of identifying the author of
an application and establishing trust relationships between applications, rather
than for controlling which applications the user can install. The certificate
does not need to be signed by a certificate authority: it is perfectly
allowable, and typical, for Android applications to use self-signed
certificates.</p>

<p>The important points to understand about signing Android applications are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All applications <em>must</em> be signed. The system will not install an application 
that is not signed.</li>
  <li>You can use self-signed certificates to sign your applications. No certificate authority 
is needed.</li>
  <li>When you are ready to publish your application, you must sign it with a suitable private 
key. You can not publish an application that is signed with the default key generated 
by the SDK tools. 
  </li>
  <li>The system tests a signer certificate's expiration date only at install time. If an 
application's signer certificate expires after the application is installed, the application 
will continue to function normally.</li>
  <li>You can use standard tools &mdash; Keytool and Jarsigner &mdash; to generate keys and 
sign your application .apk files.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Android system will not install or run an application that is not signed appropriately. This 
applies wherever the Android system is run, whether on an actual device or on the emulator. 
For this reason, you must set up signing for your application before you will be able to 
run or debug it on an emulator or device.</p>

<p>The Android SDK tools assist you in signing your applications when debugging. Both the ADT Plugin 
for Eclipse and the Ant build tool offer two signing modes &mdash; debug mode and release mode. 

<ul>
<li>In debug mode, the build tools use the Keytool utility, included in the JDK, to create 
a keystore and key with a known alias and password. At each compilation, the tools then use 
the debug key to sign the application .apk file. Because the password is known, the tools 
don't need to prompt you for the keystore/key password each time you compile.</li>

<li>When your application is ready for release, you compile it in release signing mode. 
In this mode, the tools compile your .apk <em>without</em> signing it. You must then sign
the .apk manually &mdash; <span style="color:red">with your private key</span> &mdash; 
using Jarsigner (or similar tool). If you do not have a suitable private key already, 
you can run Keytool manually to generate your own keystore/key and then sign your 
application with Jarsigner.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signing Strategies</h3>

<p>Some aspects of application signing may affect how you approach the development
of your application, especially if you are planning to release multiple
applications. </p>

<p>In general, the recommended strategy for all developers is to sign
all of your applications with the same certificate, throughout the expected
lifespan of your applications. There are several reasons why you should do so: </p>

<ul>
<li>Application upgrade &mdash; As you release upgrades to your
application, you will want to sign the upgrades with the same certificate, if you
want users to upgrade seamlessly to the new version. When the system is 
installing an update to an application, if any of the certificates in the 
new version match any of the certificates in the old version, then the 
system allows the update. If you sign the version without using a matching
certificate, you will also need to assign a different package name to the 
application &mdash; in this case, the user installs the new version as a 
completely new application. </li>

<li>Application modularity &mdash; The Android system allows applications that
are signed by the same certificate to run in the same process, if the
applications so request, so that the system treats them as a single application.
In this way you can deploy your application in modules, and users can update
each of the modules independently if needed.</li>

<li>Code/data sharing through permissions &mdash; The Android system provides
signature-based permissions enforcement, so that an application can expose
functionality to another application that is signed with a specified
certificate. By signing multiple applications with the same certificate and
using signature-based permissions checks, your applications can share code and
data in a secure manner. </li>

</ul>

<p>Another important consideration in determining your signing strategy is 
how to set the validity period of the key that you will use to sign your 
applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you plan to support upgrades for a single application, you should ensure 
that your key has a validity period that exceeds the expected lifespan of
that application. A validity period of 25 years or more is recommended. 
When your key's validity period expires, users will no longer be
able to seamlessly upgrade to new versions of your application.</li>

<li>If you will sign multiple distinct applications with the same key, 
you should ensure that your key's validity period exceeds the expected 
lifespan of <em>all versions of all of the applications</em>, including 
dependent applications that may be added to the suite in the future. </li>

<li>If you plan to publish your application(s) on Android Market, the
key you use to sign the application(s) must have a validity period 
ending after 22 October 2033. The Market server enforces this requirement
to ensure that users can seamlessly upgrade Market applications when
new versions are available. </li>
</ul>

<p>As you design your application, keep these points in mind and make sure to
use a <a href="#cert">suitable certificate</a> to sign your applications. </p>

<h3 id="setup">Basic Setup for Signing</h3>

<p>To support the generation of a keystore and debug key, you should first make sure that 
Keytool is available to the SDK build 
tools. In most cases, you can tell the SDK build tools how to find Keytool by making sure 
that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and that it references a suitable JDK. 
Alternatively, you can add the JDK version of Keytool to your PATH variable.</p>

<p>If you are developing on a version of Linux that originally came with GNU Compiler for 
Java, make sure that the system is using the JDK version of Keytool, rather than the gcj 
version. If Keytool is already in your PATH, it might be pointing to a symlink at 
/usr/bin/keytool. In this case, check the symlink target to make sure that it points 
to the Keytool in the JDK.</p>

<p>If you will release your application to the public, you will also need to have
the Jarsigner tool available on your machine. Both Jarsigner and Keytool are included
in the JDK. </p>

<h3>Signing in Debug Mode</h3>

<p>The Android build tools provide a debug signing mode that makes it easier for you 
to develop and debug your application, while still meeting the Android system
requirement for signing your .apk when it is installed in the emulator or a device. 
When you use debug mode, the SDK tools invoke Keytool to create a debug 
keystore and key. </p>

<p>The SDK tools create the debug keystore/key with predetermined names/passwords;</p>
<ul>
<li>Keystore name &mdash; "debug.keystore"</li>
<li>Keystore password &mdash; "android"</li>
<li>Key alias &mdash; "androiddebugkey"</li>
<li>Key password &mdash; "android"</li>
<li>CN &mdash; "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you are developing in Eclipse/ADT and have set up Keytool as described
above, signing in debug mode is enabled by default. When you run or debug your
application, ADT signs the .apk with the debug certificate and installs it on 
the emulator. No specific action on your part is needed, provided ADT has 
access to Keytool.</p>

<p>If you use Ant to build your .apk files, debug signing mode 
is enabled by default, assuming that you are using a build.xml file generated by the 
activitycreator tool included in the latest SDK. When you run Ant against build.xml to 
compile your app, the build script generates a keystore/key and signs the .apk for you. 
No specific action on your part is needed.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can change the location/name of the debug keystore/key or
supply a custom debug keystore/key to use. In Eclipse/ADT, you can use
<strong>Windows</strong> &gt; <strong>Prefs</strong> &gt;
<strong>Android</strong> &gt; <strong>Build</strong>. However, any custom debug
keystore/key must use the same keystore/key names and passwords as the default
debug key (as described above). </p>

<p>Note that you <em>cannot</em> release your application to the public if it 
is signed with the debug certificate. </p>

<h3>Signing for Public Release</h3>

<p>When your application is ready for release to other users, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile the application in release mode</li>
<li>Obtain a suitable private key, and then</li>
<li>Sign the application with your private key</li>
<li>Secure your private key</li>
</ol>

<p>The sections below provide information about these steps. </p>

<h4>Compiling for Release</h4>

<p>To prepare your application for release, you must first compile it in release mode. 
In release mode, the Android build tools compile your application as usual, 
but without signing it with the debug key.  </p>

<p>If you are developing in Eclipse/ADT, right-click the project in the Package 
pane and select <strong>Android Tools</strong> > <strong>Export Application 
Package</strong>. You can then specify the file location for the unsigned .apk. 
Alternatively, you can follow the "Exporting the unsigned .apk" 
link in the Manifest Editor overview page. </p>

<p>If you are using Ant, all you need to do is specify the build target 
"release" in the Ant command. For example, if you are running Ant from the 
directory containing your build.xml file, the command would look like this:</p>

<pre>$ ant release</pre>

<p>The build script compiles the application .apk without signing it. 

<p>Note that you can not release your application unsigned, or signed with the debug key.</p>

<h4 id="cert">Obtaining a Suitable Private Key</h4>

<p>In preparation for signing your application, you must first ensure that 
you have a suitable private key with which to sign. A suitable private 
key is one that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is in your possession</li>
<li>Represents the personal, corporate, or organizational entity to be identified 
with the application</li>
<li>Has a validity period that exceeds the expected lifespan of the application
or application suite. A validity period of more than 25 years is recommended. 
<p>If you plan to publish your application(s) on Android Market, note that a 
validity period ending after 22 October 2033 is a requirement. You can not upload an
application if it is signed with a key whose validity expires before that date. 
</p></li>
<li>Is not the debug key generated by the Android SDK tools. </li>
</ul>

<p>The key may be self-signed. If you do not have a suitable key, you must 
generate one using Keytool. Make sure that you have Keytool available, as described
in <a href="#setup">Basic Setup</a>.</p>

<p>To generate a self-signed key with Keytool, use the <code>keytool</code>
command and pass any of the options listed below (and any others, as
needed). </p>

<p class="warning">Before you run Keytool, make sure to read 
<a href="#secure-key">Securing Your Private Key</a> for a discussion of how to keep
your key secure and why doing so is critically important to you and to users. In
particular, when you are generating your key, you should select strong passwords
for both the keystore and key.</p>

<table>

<td><code>-keypass &lt;password&gt;</code></td><td><p>The password for the key.</p>
<p>As a security precaution, do not include this option

</tr>
</table>


<p>Here's an example of a Keytool command that generates a private key:</p>

<pre>$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore 
-alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -validity 10000</pre>

<p>Running the example command above, Keytool prompts you to provide
passwords for the keystore and key, and to provide the Distinguished
Name fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called
<code>my-release-key.keystore</code>. The keystore and key are 
protected by the passwords you entered. The keystore contains 
a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you &mdash;
will use later, to refer to this keystore when signing your application. </p>

<p>For more information about Keytool, see the documentation at

<h4>Signing Your Application</h4>

<p>When you are ready to actually sign your .apk for release, you can do so
using the Jarsigner tool. Make sure that you have Jarsigner available on your
machine, as described in <a href="#setup">Basic Setup</a>. Also, make sure that
the keystore containing your private key is  available.</p>

<p>To sign your application, you run Jarsigner, referencing both the
application's .apk and the keystore containing the private key with which to
sign the .apk. The table below shows the options you could use. <p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Jarsigner Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-keystore&nbsp;&lt;keystore-name&gt;.keystore</code></td><td>The name of
the keystore containing your private key.</td>
</tr>

<p>Here's how you would use Jarsigner to sign an application package called
<code>my_application.apk</code>, using the example keystore created above. 
</p>

<pre>$ jarsigner -verbose -keystore my-release-key.keystore 
my_application.apk alias_name</pre>

<p>Running the example command above, Jarsigner prompts you to provide
passwords for the keystore and key. It then modifies the APK 
in-place, meaning the .apk is now signed. Note that you can sign an 
APK multiple times with different keys.</p>

<p>To verify that your .apk is signed, you can use a command like this:</p>

<pre>$ jarsigner -verify my_signed.apk</pre>

<p>If the .apk is signed properly, Jarsigner prints "jar verified". 
If you want more details, you can try one of these commands:</p>

<pre>$ jarsigner -verify -verbose my_application.apk</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>$ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs my_application.apk</pre>

<p>The command above, with the <code>-certs</code> option added, will show you the 
"CN=" line that describes who created the key.</p>

<p class="note">Note: if you see "CN=Android Debug", this means the .apk was
signed with the debug key generated by the Android SDK. If you intend to release
your application, you must sign it with your private key instead of the debug
key.</p>

<p>For more information about Jarsigner, see the documentation at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/#security">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/#security</a></p>

<h4 id="secure-key">Securing Your Private Key</h4>

<p>Maintaining the security of your private key is of critical importance, both
to you and to the user. If you allow someone to use your key, or if you leave
your keystore and passwords in an unsecured location such that a third-party
could find and use them, your authoring identity and the trust of the user
are compromised. </p>

<p>If a third party should manage to take your key without your knowledge or 
permission, that person could sign and distribute applications that maliciously
replace your authentic applications or corrupt them. Such a person could also
sign and distribute applications under your identity that attack other 
applications or the system itself, or corrupt or steal user data. </p>

<p>Your reputation as a developer entity depends on your securing your private
key properly, at all times, until the key is expired. Here are some tips for
keeping your key secure: </p>

<ul>
<li>Select strong passwords for the keystore and key.</li>
<li>When you generate your key with Keytool, <em>do not</em> supply the 
<code>-storepass</code> and <code>-keypass</code> options at the command line. 
If you do so, your passwords will be available in your shell history, 
which any user on your computer could access.</li>
<li>Similarly, when signing your applications with Jarsigner, 
<em>do not</em> supply the <code>-storepass</code> and <code>-keypass</code> 
options at the command line. </li>
<li>Do not give or lend anyone your private key, and do not let unauthorized
persons know your keystore and key passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, if you follow common-sense precautions when generating, using,
and storing your key, it will remain secure. </p>

<h3>Expiry of the Debug Certificate</h3>

<p>The self-signed certificate used to sign your application in debug mode (the default on 
Eclipse/ADT and Ant builds) will have an expiration date of 365 days from its creation date.</p>

<p>When the certificate expires, you will get a build error. On Ant builds, the error 
looks like this:</p>

<pre>debug:
[echo] Packaging bin/samples-debug.apk, and signing it with a debug key...
[exec] Debug Certificate expired on 8/4/08 3:43 PM</pre>

<p>In Eclipse/ADT, you will see a similar error in the Android console.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, simply delete the <code>debug.keystore</code> file. On Linux/Mac OSX, 
the file is stored in <code>~/.android</code>. On Windows XP, the file is stored in <code>
C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data\Android</code>. 
On Windows Vista, the file is stored in <code>
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Android</code>.</p>

<p>The next time you build, the build tools will regenerate a new keystore and debug key.</p>

<p>Note that, if your development machine is using a non-Gregorian locale, the build 
tools may erroneously generate an already-expired debug certificate, so that you get an 
error when trying to compile your application. For workaround information, see the 
troubleshooting topic <a href="../kb/troubleshooting.html#signingcalendar">
I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;compile my app because the build tools generated an expired debug 
certificate</a>. </p>

<h2 id="ppublishing">Preparing to Publish Your Applications</h2>

<p>If you plan to publish your application for installation on Android devices,
there are several things you need to do, to get your application ready. The list
below describes some of the significant checkpoints for preparing your
application. </p>

<p>If you will publish your application on Android Market, please also see <a
href="#market">Publishing on Android Market</a> for specific requirements for
your application. </p>

<div class="special">

<p>Before you consider your application ready for release:</p>

<ol>
<li>Test your application extensively on an actual device </li>
<li>Consider adding an End User License Agreement in your application</li>
<li>Specify an icon and label in the application's manifest</li>
<li>Turn off logging and debugging and clean up data/files</li>
</ol>

<p>Before you do the final compile of your application:</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Version your application</li>
<li>Obtain a suitable cryptographic key</li>
<li>Register for a Maps API Key, if your application is using MapView elements</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Compile your application...</em></p>
<p>After compiling your application:</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Sign your application</li>
<li>Test your compiled application</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Before you consider your application ready for release</h3>

<h4 id="test">1. Test your application extensively on an actual device</h4>

<p>It's important to test your application as extensively as possible, in as
many areas as possible. To help you do that, Android provides a variety of
testing classes and tools. You can use 
<a href="../reference/android/app/Instrumentation.html">Instrumentation</a> to run JUnit and other 
test cases, and you can use testing
tools such as the <a href="../reference/monkey.html">UI/Application
Exerciser Monkey</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>To ensure that your application will run properly for users, you should make
every effort to obtain one or more physical mobile device(s) of the type on
which you expect the application to run. You should then test your application
on the actual device, under realistic network conditions. Testing  your
application on a physical device is very important, because it enables you to
verify that your user interface elements are sized correctly (especially for
touch-screen UI) and that your application's performance and battery efficiency
are acceptable.</li>

<li>If you can not obtain a mobile device of the type you are targeting for your
application, you can use emulator options such as <code>-dpi</code>,
<code>-device</code>, <code>-scale</code>, <code>-netspeed</code>,
<code>-netdelay</code>, <code>-cpu-delay</code> and others to model the
emulator's screen, network performance, and other attributes to match the target
device to the greatest extent possible. You can then test your application's UI
and performance. However, we strongly recommend that you test your application
on an actual target device before publishing it. </li>

<li>If you are targeting the <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/">T-Mobile
G1</a> device for your application, make sure that your UI handles screen
orientation changes. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="eula">2. Consider adding an End User License Agreement in your 
application</h4>

<p>To protect your person, organization, and intellectual property, you may want
to provide an End User License Agreement (EULA) with your application. 

<h4>3. Specify an icon and label in the application's manifest</h4>

<p>The icon and label that you specify in an application's manifest are
important because they are displayed to users as your application's icon and
name. They are displayed on the device's Home screen, as well as in Manage
Applications, My Downloads, and elsewhere. Additionally, publishing services may
display the icon and label to users. </p>

<p>To specify an icon and label, you define the attributes
<code>android:icon</code> and <code>android:label</code> in the 
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element of the manifest. </p>

<p>As regards the design of your icon, you should try to make it match as much
as possible the style used by the built-in Android applications.</p>

<h4>4. Turn off logging and debugging and clean up data/files</h4>

<p>For release, you should make sure that debug facilities are turned off and
that debug and other unnecessary data/files are removed from your application
project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the <code>android:debuggable="true"</code> attribute from the
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element of the manifest.</li>
<li>Remove log files, backup files, and other unnecessary files from the
application project.</li>
<li>Check for private or proprietary data and remove it as necessary.</li>
<li>Deactivate any calls to <a href="../reference/android/util/Log.html">Log</a> methods in the source
code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Before you do the final compile of your application</h3>

<h4>5. Version Your Application</h4>

<p>Before you compile your application, you must make sure that you have defined
a version number for your application, specifying an appropriate value for both
the <code>android:versionCode</code> and <code>android:versionName</code>
attributes of the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element in the application's
manifest file. Carefully consider your version numbering plans in the context of
your overall application upgrade strategy. </p>

<p>If you have previously released a version of your application, you must make
sure to increment the version number of the current application. You must
increment both the <code>android:versionCode</code> and
<code>android:versionName</code> attributes of the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code>
element in the application's manifest file, using appropriate values. </p>

<p>For detailed information about how to define version information for your
application, see <a href="#versioning">Versioning Your Application</a>.</p>

<h4>6. Obtain a suitable cryptographic key</h4>

<p>If you have read and followed all of the preparation steps up to this point,
your application is compiled and ready for signing. Inside the .apk, the
application is properly versioned, and you've cleaned out extra files and
private data, as described above. </p>

<p>Before you sign your application, you need to make sure that you have a
suitable private key. For complete information about how to obtain (or generate)
a private key, see <a href="#cert">Obtaining a Private Key</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have obtained (or generated) a suitable private key, you will use it
to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register for a Maps API Key (see below), if your application uses MapView
elements.</li>
<li>Sign your application for release</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="mapsApiKey">7. Register for a Maps API Key, if your application is using
MapView elements</h4>

<div class="sidebox" style="margin-bottom:.5em;"><p>For complete information
about getting a Maps API Key, see <a
href="../toolbox/apis/mapkey.html">Obtaining a Maps API
Key</a>.<br></p></div>

<p>If your application uses one or more 
<a href="../reference/com/google/android/maps/MapView.html">Mapview</a> elements, you will need to 
register your application with the Google
Maps service and obtain a Maps API Key, before your MapView(s) will be able to
retrieve data from Google Maps. To do so, you supply an MD5 fingerprint of your
signer certificate to the Maps service. </p>

<p>During development, you can get a temporary Maps API Key by registering the
debug key generated by the SDK tools. However, before publishing your
application, you must register for a new Maps API Key that is based on your
private key. </p>

<p>If your application uses MapView elements, the important points to understand
are:</p>

<ol>
<li>You <em>must</em> obtain the Maps API Key before you compile your
application for release, because you must add the Key to a special attribute in
each MapView element &mdash; <code>android:apiKey</code> &mdash; in your
application's layout files. If you are instantiating MapView objects directly
from code, you must pass the Maps API Key as a parameter in the constructor.
</li>
<li>The Maps API Key referenced by your application's MapView elements must be
registered (in Google Maps) to the certificate used to sign the application.
This is particularly important when publishing your application &mdash; your
MapView elements must reference a Key that is registered to the release
certificate that you will use to sign your application.  </li>
<li>If you previously got a temporary Maps API Key by registering the debug
certificate generated by the SDK tools, you <em>must</em> remember to obtain a
new Maps API Key by registering your release certificate. You must then remember
to change the MapView elements to reference the new Key, rather than the Key
associated with the debug certificate. If you do not do so, your MapView
elements will not have permission to download Maps data. </li>
<li>If you change the private key that you will use to sign your application,
you <em>must</em> remember to obtain a new Maps API Key from the Google Maps
service. If you do not get a new Maps API Key and apply it to all MapView
elements, any MapView elements referencing the old Key will not have permission
to download Maps data. </li>
</ol>

<p>For more information about signing and your private key, see <a
href="#signing">Signing Your Applications</a>.</p>


<h3 id="compile">Compile Your Application</h3>

<p>When you've prepared your application as described in the previous sections,
you can compile your application for release. </p>

<h3 id="post-compile">After Compiling Your Application</h3>

<h4>8. Sign Your Application</h4>

<p>Sign your application using your private key. Signing your application
correctly is critically important. Please see <a href="#signing">Signing Your
Applications</a> for complete information. </p>

<h4>9. Test Your Compiled and Signed Application</h4>

<p>Before you release your compiled application, you should thoroughly test it
on the target mobile device (and target network, if possible). In particular,
you should make sure that any MapView elements in your UI are receiving maps
data properly. If they are not, go back to <a href="#mapsApiKey">Register for a
Maps API Key</a> and correct the problem. You should also ensure that the
application works correctly with any server-side services and data that you are
providing or are relying on and that the application handles any authentication
requirements correctly.  </p>

<p>After testing, you are now ready to publish your application to mobile device
users.</p>

<h2 id="publishing">Publishing Your Applications</h2>

<p>If you've followed the steps outlined in <a href="#ppublishing">Preparing to
Publish Your Applications</a>, the result of the process is a compiled .apk that
is signed with your release private key. Inside the .apk, the application is
properly versioned and any MapView elements reference a Maps API Key that you
obtained by registering the MD5 fingerprint of the same certificate used to sign
the .apk. Your application is now ready for publishing. </p>

<p>The sections below provide information about publishing your Android
application to mobile device users.</p>

<p>Android Market is a hosted service that makes it easy for users to find and
download Android applications to their Android-powered devices, and makes it 
easy for developers to publish their applications to Android users.</p>

<p>To publish your application on Android Market, you first need to register
with the service using your Google account and agree to the terms of service.
Once you are registered, you can upload your application to the service whenever
you want, as many times as you want, and then publish it when you are ready.
Once published, users can see your application, download it, and rate it using
the Market application installed on their Android-powered devices. </p>

<p>To register as an Android Market developer and get started with publishing,
visit the Android Market: </p>

<p style="margin-left:3em;"><a
href="http://market.android.com/publish">http://market.android.com/publish</a>
</p>

<p>If you plan to publish your application on Android Market, you must make sure
that it meets the requirements listed below, which are enforced by the Market
server when you upload the application.</p>

<div class="special">
<p>Requirements enforced by the Android Market server</p>
<ol>
<li>Your application must be signed with a cryptographic private key whose
validity period ends after <span style="color:red">22 October 2033</span>. </li>
<li>Your application must define both an <code>android:versionCode</code> and an
<code>android:versionName</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code>
element of its manifest. The server uses the <code>android:versionCode</code> as
the basis for identifying the application internally and handling upgrades, and
it displays the <code>android:versionName</code> to users as the application's
version.</li>
<li>Your application must define both an <code>android:icon</code> and an
<code>android:label</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code>
element of its manifest.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4 id="marketupgrade">Publishing Upgrades on Android Market</h4>

<p>The beta version of Android Market does not support notifying your users when
you publish a new version of your application. This capability will be
added soon, but currently the user must independently initiate download of an
upgraded application. When you publish an upgrade, you can assist users by
notifying them that the upgrade is available and giving them a way to download
the upgraded application from Android Market.</p>

<p>Here is a suggested way of tracking installed application versions and
notifying users that an upgrade is available:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have your app occasionally check in with a web-service that you're
running. This web service should return two values: the latest available
version number for the application (corresponding to
<code>android:versionCode</code>) and a URI string that your application
can later send in an Intent, to launch Market and search for the
upgraded application for the user. 

<p>The URI that your web service returns should be properly formatted to 
search Android Market for your upgraded application. See 
<a href="#marketintent">Using Intents to Launch the Market Application</a> 
for more information. The URI should specify the upgraded 
application's package name as the query parameter, since the package name
is guaranteed to be unique on Android Market. The URI format for the 
package name search is: </p>

<p><code>http://market.android.com/search?q=pname:&lt;package&gt;</code> or 
<br><code>market://search?q=pname:&lt;package&gt;</code></p>

</li>
<li>Your application can then compare its own version number against
that retrieved.  If the retrieved value is greater, your application can
show a dialog informing the user that a new version is available. The
dialog can offer buttons to begin the download or cancel. </li> <li>If
the user clicks the button to begin the download, your application can
call startActivity() using the ACTION_VIEW Intent, passing the URI
received from your web service. The Intent launches the Market
application on the device and initiates an immediate search on the
Android Market site, based on the query parameters in the URI. When the
result is displayed, the user can view the details of the upgraded
application and begin the download. 

<p>Note that, because the URI string is received from your web 
service and not hard-coded into your application, you can easily change
the Market launch behaviors whenever needed, without 
having to change your application. </p></li></ol>

<p>For more information about URIs you can pass to the Market application at
launch, see <a href="#marketintent">Using Intents to Launch the Market
Application</a>, below.</p>

<h4 id="marketintent">Using Intents to Launch the Market Application on 
a Device</h4>

<p>Android-powered devices include a preinstalled Market application that gives
users access to the Android Market site. From Market, users can
browse or search available applications, read ratings and reviews, and
download/install applications.</p>

<p>You can launch the Market application from another Android
application by sending an Intent to the system. You might want to do
this, for example, to help the user locate and download an upgrade to an
installed application, or to let the user know about related
applications that are available for download. </p>

<p>To launch Market, you send an ACTION_VIEW Intent, passing a Market-handled
URI string as the Intent data. In most cases, your application would call
startActivity() to send the ACTION_VIEW Intent with the Market-handled URI.</p>

<p>The URI that you supply with the Intent lets the system route the intent
properly and also expresses the type of action that you want Market to perform
after launch. Currently, you can have Market initiate a search for applications
on Android Market, based on query parameters that you provide. For example, you
can specify URIs to search for applications by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Package name</li>
<li>Developer name</li>
<li>String match across application name, developer name, and
description, or </li>
<li>Any combination of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the URI queries return results from the public metadata supplied by
developers in their Android Market profiles or application publishing
information, but not from the developer's private account or from the
certificate used to sign the application. </p>

<p>The table below provides a list of URIs and actions currently
supported by the Market application.</p>
